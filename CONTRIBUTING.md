## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [Otorp.js repository](https://gitlab.com/tdj.dev/otorp) on GitLab.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/Otorp.js.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, improvements, or bug fixes while adhering to the existing coding conventions.

5. **Test Your Changes**: Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected. You can also write unit tests if applicable.

6. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages that describe the purpose of your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add new feature: your feature name"
   ```

7. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Merge Request**: Open a merge request (MR) from your branch to Otorp.js [main repository](https://gitlab.com/tdj.dev/otorp/-/merge_requests). Provide a detailed description of your changes, their purpose, and any relevant information.

9. Participate in the code review process and address any feedback or comments from the maintainers.

10. Once your MR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch, and your changes will become part of Otorp.js.

## Code Style and Guidelines
<!--
### Project Structure

Our project structure follows a clear organization to enhance maintainability:

- **`src/`**: Core source files.
- **`tests/`**: Test suite.
- **`dist/`**: Compiled and minified files.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation resources.
-->
### Coding Conventions

Maintaining a consistent and well-structured codebase is crucial for the long-term maintainability of the project. Adhering to these coding conventions helps ensure clarity, readability, and collaborative development:

- **Indentation**: Use a 2-space indentation to maintain a clean and consistent code layout.

- **Naming**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and methods to enhance code understanding.

- **Comments**: Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of utility functions, method prototypes, complex logic, and edge cases.

- **Modularity**: Avoid multi-layer of local functionality and divide them into clear and reusable modules, promoting code organization and reusability.

- **ES6+ Features**: Embrace modern JavaScript features and syntax enhancements to write more concise and efficient code.

By following these conventions, you contribute to a codebase that's not only easier to understand but also more collaborative and future-proof.

### Comment Structure
**Consistent and Clear Commenting**

Consistency in commenting is crucial for maintaining code readability and promoting collaboration. To achieve this, all feature comments should adhere to the following standardized syntax:.

```js
/** A brief summary of the feature's purpose or its name if self-explanatory.
 *
 * Provide a detailed description explaining the functionality and intended use of the feature.
 * This description can span multiple lines.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Illustrate the feature's usage with a practical code example.
 * a + b === c
 * 
 * ...@other tags
 */
```

**Why this structure**

This well-defined structure not only ensures clarity but also aids comprehension of various feature types within the codebase. It allows for quick comprehension even when comments are collapsed, maintaining a clean code appearance while conveying essential information about the feature.

### GitLab Workflows

Our CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality:

- **Linting**: Code is checked for style issues.
- **Testing**: Automated tests are run for validation.
- **Distribution**: Distribution files are generated.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/tdj.dev/otorp/-/issues) on GitLab to see if it has already been reported. If not, feel free to create a new issue and provide as much detail as possible. This includes a clear and concise description of the problem or requested feature, steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable), and any relevant code examples.
